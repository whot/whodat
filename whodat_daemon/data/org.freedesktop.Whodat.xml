    org.freedesktop.Whodat:
    @short_description: Device identification interface

    An interface to provide device identification for evdev and hidraw devices.
    This allows a caller with access to a single device to obtain more information
    about this device that it may otherwise not be privileged enough to access to.

    For example, a game controller may have several evdev event nodes including
    a touchpad event node. If only the touchpad evdev node is passed to a process,
    that process cannot be aware that this is part of a gaming device.

    Using whodat it can pass that fd to the whodat daemon which will provide
    the process to also gather information about the parent device, including that
    this device is a game controller.

    This interface is available on the `org.freeedesktop.Whodat` session bus
    on the `/org/freedesktop/whodat` object path.
